What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    It allows me to choose which files I want to commit, even if multiple files
    have changed at the same time. This might allow me to commit an important change
    at the same time I'm working on a minor change on different files.
