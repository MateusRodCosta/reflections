When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

		So I can both share with others my work, work collaboratively, or have a backup somewhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

		This way you are less likely to get external changes that conflict with	what you
		are currently working on, e.g. someone else has merged a feature into branch
		master and you have some changes on master which might conflict.
