When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

		So I can both share with others my work, work collaboratively, or have a backup somewhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

		This way you are less likely to get external changes that conflict with	what you
		are currently working on, e.g. someone else has merged a feature into branch
		master and you have some changes on master which might conflict.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

		Forks are clones of repositories on Github, clones are copies of repositories
		with all its files and commit history, and branches are ways to logically
		separate (as in, diverting from a common ancestor) commits based on what the
		programmer intends on doing.
